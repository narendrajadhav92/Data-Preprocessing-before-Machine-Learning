    "#### Imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to handle a missing value is to substitute it with an actual value. This has the benefit of not throwing the feature or sample away completely and in most cases outperforms the alternative. The catch is that we have to devise a **strategy** on how to impute the values. Ideally, we'd like the value we set to be *realistic*. If not, we'll just add noise to the dataset. When strategizing on how to impute data, one must consider each feature separately (e.g. how can we impute 'age'? how can we impute 'sex'?).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before considering which value to add, we must take a look on the **mechanisms** that cause the *missingness*. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three such mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing Completely At Random (MCAR)**:  \n",
    "Values that are missing due to no observable pattern, belong in this category. For example, someone forgot to write down a measurement, an entry was corrupted, a sensor malfunctioned, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing At Random (MAR)**:  \n",
    "Regardless of what the name implies, these values **aren't** exactly missing at random. Instead the reason they are missing is **dependent on another feature present in the dataset**. An example of MAR in the above data would be if women were more likely to not enter their age.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing Not At Random (MNAR)**:  \n",
    "This category consists of values that are missing **because of their actual value**. For example, a sensor failed to take a measurement because its value was too high (outside manufacturer's limits), someone didn't fill his occupation in a survey because he's unemployed, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most intuitive way to impute a feature is through **single imputation**, in which each missing value is replaced with a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the first feature, i.e. *age*.  \n",
    "The first thing to do is to check if this feature represents a continuous or a discrete variable; in this case it's a continuous variable.  \n",
    "Afterwards, we'll need to check which of the three mechanisms mentioned previously, caused the *missingness*. Since we don't have a way to know which one of the three it is, we're left to make an educated guess. We'll **assume** that the values are MCAR (note that all we can do is assume on the nature of the *missingness*; we can never be sure).  \n",
    "For the actual imputation strategy, we'll try to select a value that affects the distribution of the variable as little as possible. Some strategies we could apply would be filling NaN values with the *mean*, *median* or *mode* of the variable."

If we filled all the missing values with students we would have 7:2 ratio between these two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach would be to assume an association between *education* and another feature (i.e. MAR); the most apparent is between this and *age*. One way to take advantage of this would be to **train a classifier** (e.g. logistic regression) to predict the person's *education* based on his *age*. The classifier would be trained on the rows that have both an *age* and an *education* and would be called to predict on the rows that don't have an *education*. We'll see this in more detail, in a bit. We could even take it one step further and train the classifier on the entirety of the dataset (besides *education*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to change things up, we'll **assume a MNAR mechanism**. This means that we consider the missingness of the values has something to do with the value itself. For example, people with a high school education didn't fill out their *education* because the option 'high school' wasn't on the form. If this assumption stands, it is wrong to fill the *education* with an already existing value (e.g. most frequent, based on another feature). The only thing we can do is to create a new category (e.g. 'Other') and replace all missing values with that."

    "To sum up, up till now we've seen two options for dealing with missing values: removing them or imputing them. The first can be either accomplished by dropping the column(s) or the row(s) that contain the missing values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second is a bit trickier. To successfully impute a missing value, we need to first check what type of values it contains (i.e. continuous or discrete) and make an assumption on the nature of its \"missingness\". \n",
    "\n",
    "- If we think that the values are MCAR we should impute with a value that doesn't alter the viable much from a statistical point of view; some options are the mean, the median, the mode, etc. \n",
    "- If our assumption was that the values are MNAR, we should create a new category and impute the missing values with that category.\n",
    "- In most cases, the safest assumption is to consider the values to be MAR. In this case we could either impute the values empirically (like we did with *sex* above) or through regression/classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the above fall under a category called **single imputation**, because only **one** value is produced for each missing value.\n",

    "In contrast, in **multiple imputation** a total of **$M$ candidate values** are produced for each missing value. The $M$ values are then **pooled** together to produce the final single value. Multiple imputation techniques work best on MAR variables, where they can reduce the bias and make the estimation more precise. Furthermore, through analysis of the $M$ imputed datasets, we infer on the uncertainty associated with the estimation of the missing data. Obviously. these techniques have the drawback of a larger computation time and larger memory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best-known techniques is **Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE)**. This technique operates under the assumption that all missing values are MAR. Briefly, what it does is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First it replaces all missing values in the dataset with a placeholder, e.g. the feature's mean.\n",
    "2. Then it selects one feature (usually the one that had the least missing values) and reverts the previous step, by removing the placeholders.\n",
    "3. Afterwards it performs a regression/classification with all the remaining features as the data and the previously selected one as its labels.\n",
    "4. Finally, it repeats steps 2-3 until all features with missing values are processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This whole procedure is repeated for a number of \"cycles\", usually $5-10$ times to create multiple datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, [scikit-learn's imputation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html#impute) sub-module offers only the most basic techniques. If we want something more sophisticated we'll either have to do it ourselves or through a dedicated package (e.g. [fancyimpute](https://github.com/iskandr/fancyimpute), [statsmodels.imputation.mice](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/imputation.html#module-statsmodels.imputation.mice))\n",

    "\n",
    "- Engine Capacity ranges from $1000$ to $4000$.\n",
    "- Power Output ranges $70$ to $500$.\n",
    "- Fuel Capacity ranges $35$ to $70$.\n",
    "- Number of doors range from $3$ to $5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature scaling is important for ensuring that ML algorithms pay the same attention to all features. Imagine a k-NN classifier that uses the Euclidean distance. When attempting to train this model in a dataset whose features differ in range, the distance will be governed by the features that have the broadest range. Another reason is that Gradient Descent converges faster on scaled features.\n",

    "The difference becomes apparent when looking at the distributions above: `feature 1` had a much larger range of values than `feature 2`, which would cause problems to many classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "By **normalizing** them, we brought them to exactly the same range of values. Because `feature 1` had some outliers, the procedure \"condensed\" the *bulk* of its samples to a very short range (i.e. between $[0, 0.2)$), which caused it to be rather leptokurtic. If this effect is undesirable, we can try removing the outliers beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standardizing**, on the other hand, doesn't apply a *strict* limitation on the feature's range. Instead, it attempts to bring the distributions to share the same characteristics ($μ=0$ and $σ=1$). The fact that the outliers remain at high values, has caused the bulk of the samples to occupy a broad enough range (i.e. between $[-2, +2]$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we add a scaler in scikit-learn. Note that we should fit the scaler **only** on the training set (in order to calculate the mean and standard deviation of this set) and then transform **both** sets with this scaler.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n",
    "\n",
    "scaler = StandardScaler()  # define scaler\n",
    "scaler.fit(train)  # fit scaler ONLY on the training data\n",
    "\n",
    "# transform on both sets:\n",
    "train_scaled = scaler.transform(train)\n",
    "test_scaled = scaler.transform(test)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing functions also have a `.fit_transform()` methods which we could have used like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(train)  # we should still fit the scaler ONLY on the training data\n",
    "test_scaled = scaler.transform(test)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is scikit-learn's [RobustScaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.RobustScaler.html) which helps in dealing with outliers."
